<p>(Last Updated: May 11, 2024)</p>

<p> Currently, I am a research assistant at the Singapore University of Technology and Design, where I work under <a href="https://info.roylee.sg/">Dr. Roy Lee</a> exploring Meme Analytics.</p>

<p> I recently graduated with a Bachelor in Computer Science and Engineering from <a href="https://www.iitp.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Patna</a>. I was fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.iitp.ac.in/~sriparna/">Dr. Sriparna Saha</a> and <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/">Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya</a> at <a href="https://www.iitp.ac.in/~ai-nlp-ml/">AI-NLP-ML Lab, IIT Patna</a>. There, I worked on a variety of NLP problems, including online safety, complaint mining, and AI for healthcare. Additionally, I have also collaborated with researchers from Microsoft and Amazon AI. </p>

<p>My research interests include natural language processing (NLP) and AI safety. However, I am always eager to explore new research directions.</p>
